# Class lecture notes and exercise notebooks
This repository serves as an archive of my class lecture notes. I will try to keep the main branch to the most up-to-date version, and keep an archive of older notes in separate branches.

Slides and notebooks for [TTK master student introduction at RWTH Aachen 2025](https://github.com/MarkMos/class_lecture/tree/aachen-2025)
Slides and notebooks for [École d'été Rodolphe Clédassou 2025](https://github.com/MarkMos/class_lecture/tree/ecole-euclid-2025)

Introductory slides and exercises for [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public).

With thanks to [Nils Schöneberg](https://schoeneberg.github.io/) for useful discussions and sharing slides for the previous years' lectures.
